    To use this dashboard, you need to first upload the files in üè† Home page (first page opened), which you can access from the sidebar on the left:

        - Network Edges file: containing the relationships of authors
        - Node Information file: containing information snippet of authors that can be used for filtering

    _**Please reach out to Business Development team to get the latest version of these files**_
